## Description

This is a REST API resembling a movie database same as IMDb. The data about users and notes is stored is PostgreSQL database. The API is documented with Swagger. The API uses ***JWT authentication*** for user authentication. The API is hosted at https://neofi-y8ef.onrender.com/ and uses a hosted PostgreSQL database. Both the service and the database are based and deployed on **Render**, the hosting platform. 

The API is hosted using the free service on Render, which means it'll go down due to inactivity until unless brought backup. It's best to start the server and test this API locally using Postman or cURL.

If the hosted service is online, you can start using it like `https://neofi-y8ef.onrender.com/auth/signup` and same goes for rest of the endpoints.

**Packages used for this project**
- Flask
- Flask-RESTx

2. Change the app directory <br>
    `cd NeoFi` 
3. Activate the virtual environment <br>

P.S :- I've made the API using Flask but if the job requires I'm ready to learn Django. I lack in experience in testing out the endpoints automatically. Hence, I couldn't create a system for automated testing. I'd like you to consider for me for a internship role if my application does not suffice for a full-time role at your company. Thank You
